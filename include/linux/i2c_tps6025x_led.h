/* TPS6025X part supports up to seven LEDs. Each LED belongs to
 * one of three LED groups. Each group can be controlled independently,
 * but the LEDs that belong to the same group cannot be controlled
 * separately.
 *
 * 1) Main Display LED group: DM1 through DM4.
 *    64 steps of brightness
 *    For 0 < current < 1.5mA, one step is 0.1mA
 *    For 1.5mA < current < 25.5mA, one step is 0.5mA
 *
 * 2) Sub Display LED group: DS1 and DS2
 *    64 steps of brightness
 *    For 0 < current < 1.5mA, one step is 0.1mA
 *    For 1.5mA < current < 25.5mA, one step is 0.5mA
 *
 * 3) Aux Display LED group: DM5.
 *    Aux display LED can be configured in Main Display Mode or
 *    Aux Display Mode.
 *    
 *    In Main Display Mode, 64 steps of brightness is supported
 *    with maximum current of 25mA. It will behave like two groups
 *    above.
 *
 *    In Aux Display Mode, only 4 steps (20%, 40%, 70%, and 100%)
 *    of brightness is supported, with maximum current of 80mA.
