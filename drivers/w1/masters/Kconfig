config W1_MASTER_MATROX
	tristate "Matrox G400 transport layer for 1-wire"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to communicate with your 1-wire devices
	  using Matrox's G400 GPIO pins.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called matrox_w1.ko.

config W1_MASTER_DS2490
	tristate "DS2490 USB <-> W1 transport layer for 1-wire"
  	depends on USB
  	help
	  Say Y here if you want to have a driver for DS2490 based USB <-> W1 bridges,
	  for example DS9490*.

  	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds2490.ko.

config W1_MASTER_DS2482
	tristate "Maxim DS2482 I2C to 1-Wire bridge"
	depends on I2C && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for the Maxim DS2482
	  I2C to 1-Wire bridge.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called ds2482.

config W1_MASTER_DS1WM
	tristate "Maxim DS1WM 1-wire busmaster"
	depends on W1 && ARM
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the DS1WM 1-wire driver, such as that
	  in HP iPAQ devices like h5xxx, h2200, and ASIC3-based like
	  hx4700.

config W1_MASTER_OMAP
	tristate "OMAP3430 HDQ and 1-wire busmaster"
	depends on W1 && (ARCH_OMAP3430 || ARCH_OMAP24XX)
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the OMAP 3430 HDQ/1-wire driver for 
	  OMAP 3430 communications with 1-wire or HDQ devices such i
	  as battery monitor (gas gauge) IC's

config OMAP3430_HDQ_SYSFS
	depends on W1_MASTER_OMAP
	bool "HDQ driver sysfs support"
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want sysfs support for the HDQ port on OMAP 3430

config OMAP3430_HDQ_PROTOCOL
	depends on W1_MASTER_OMAP
	bool "HDQ protocol support on OMAP"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want support for the HDQ Interface instead 
	  of the 1-wire interface on the OMAP processor.

config OMAP3430_1WIRE_PROTOCOL
	depends on W1_MASTER_OMAP
	bool "One wire support on OMAP"
        default y
        ---help---
          Say Y here if you want to use the 1-wire protocol 
          on the OMAP processor instead of the HDQ protocol
