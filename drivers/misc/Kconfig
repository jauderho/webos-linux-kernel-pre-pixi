config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && INPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.

	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.
